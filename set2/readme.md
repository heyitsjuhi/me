TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
update
Reflection statement: this week was using logic and solving if elif statements
and recreating the given pattern. I found it challenging at first but gradually
with the help of my tutor i was able to understand how to solve these codes.
and also I found youtube videos on this topic very helpful.
